## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `kNN.py` file.

2. Navigate to the directory containing `kNN.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

3. Execute the script with the following command:

python DecisionTree.py input.csv output.txt

Replace `<train_csv_file>` with the path to the CSV file containing the training data, `<test_csv_file>` with the path to the CSV file containing the test data, `<output_csv_file>` with the desired path for the output CSV file, and `<k_value>` with the desired value for the parameter `k` in the kNN algorithm.

Example:

`python DecisionTree.py rtg_A.csv output.txt`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
